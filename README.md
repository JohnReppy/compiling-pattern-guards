# Compiling Pattern Guards

This repository containts prototype implementations of the algorithms described in
the paper *Compiling Successor ML Pattern Guards*, which was presented at the
[2019 ML Family Workshop](https://icfp19.sigplan.org/home/mlfamilyworkshop-2019)
by John Reppy and Mona Zhair.

There is also a revised version of the ML Workshop paper (some typos have been
fixed) and a copy of the slides from the talk.
